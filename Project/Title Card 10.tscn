text = "A torn human face; a splatter running from the baseboard to the lateral edge of the ceiling;
 a shotgun thrown from the armchair with unconscious strength. 
Splayed out across the surface area of a leather recliner, a weathered man without a face. 
On the table next to him, spared from the worst of the splash damage, 
is a piece of paper - slightly yellowed and cracked. It reads;

They’ve come. They’ve come. They’re here and they’re here to kill. I cannot stay and I 
cannot bare the pain. I told them they would do it and i told them it would end us all, 
but no one would help. They’ve come and I cannot do anything to stop it. 
They’re here and they’re here to kill. They’ve come.
