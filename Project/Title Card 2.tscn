text = "You were sat upon the same bus that you woke up in, at some point earlier in time. 
On a long stretch of highway, with headphones on and mind wandering, 
your gaze switched from watching the odd passenger on the bus and chewing the passing 
scenery. Suddenly, the world around you turns stark white. Everyone on the bus shields 
their eyes and screams in terror. You turn away from the window and cover your face in
 your sleeve, but as soon as you do, a large boom reverberates outward from somewhere 
in the distance. And as you look back out the window, the bus is struck by an invisible force,
 and your vision goes black.
