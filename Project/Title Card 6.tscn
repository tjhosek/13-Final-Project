text = "This location looks like less of a home and more of a lean-to - held up by nothing more 
than scrap sheet metal and a few worryingly thin slabs of wood. The roof is a heap of mix 
matched swatches and bits of stone and linoleum. Where there would normally be a door, 
there is a car door, torn and jagged in the areas where it would’ve been connected to a 
vessel. Inside, there is no real unification between the decor or furniture - it’s a similarly 
random abundance of whatever could be found. Colors, washed out from time spent in the 
sun and muddled by the stains that cover it, clash with one another 
and create an eye sore of a hovel.
