text = "You wake up inside of an empty bus. 
The windows have been blown out, the metal has rusted and warped. 
Stale air, noted by its minerality and dryness, invades your nostrils and jolts you to 
a sitting position. A harsh but hazy light bursts through the empty holes in the frame 
of the blown out bus, blinding you and pushing you back downward. As your eyes 
start to wander, you notice that Everything around you looks dirty and wasted: 
carrying its own particular load of dust and grime. 
Past the haze of confusion, you start to recollect the events that led you to this situation. "
