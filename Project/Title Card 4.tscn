text = "House #1:
You enter the home and find a fairly normal setting. Pictures along the mantle, 
shoes piled up near the front door, and an indescribable amount of toys strewn throughout. 
Looking at the pictures, you can see that the family was made up of a single father 
and two young boys. Despite the appearance outside, it doesn’t look like any sort of 
ravaging had happened inside the home. Everything gives off the appearance that it was 
a fairly normal day- up until the boom that knocked you out. While it’s nothing horribly 
unconcerning, you can’t help but be mildly perturbed by the normalcy inside the home. 
With such a direct contrast to the outside world, you wonder 
if there is something you’re missing here.
