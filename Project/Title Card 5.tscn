text = "House #2:
In direct contrast to the last home you entered, this one looks like the wrath of god tore 
through it. Whereas the home of the family seemed eerily clean, this one is concerningly 
destroyed. Broken dinnerware is all over; a thin layer of dust and grime sits atop every 
foreign object in sight. Glass is strewn everywhere and every outlet to the exterior of the 
home is blown out, as if an atomic bomb went off within the confines of this home and 
this home alone. There is very little to gather from your surroundings in here; 
unless you have a particular affinity for piecing together broken bits of glass 
like a sadomasochistic jigsaw puzzle
