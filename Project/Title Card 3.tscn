text = "As you observe everything around you, it becomes glaringly obvious that you are the only 
person on the bus. There is the odd strewn garment hanging over the back of a seat, 
the random shoe left in the hurry of the moment, but the only remnant of life on the vessel 
is you. However, sat upon a seat somewhat out of your reach, is a car battery. 
It’s dirty, with the occasional bit of acid coating the exterior, but in comparison to everything 
around you, it’s looking pretty good. With stiff muscles and a hearty ache in the center of 
your head, you rise to inspect the car battery further. 
You pick up the car battery and exit the bus.
Around you there is nothing but desolate and fragmented remnants of the distant town 
you were passing through when the event happened. Near you, there are five houses and 
one larger building. In the far distance, you can see more homes, and what appears to be a 
car. You decide to make your way into that direction, although it looks like it might be quite 
a distance. Maybe the homes that dot the landscape in front of you will provide some sort of 
explanation for what has happened in the time since that blinding light.
