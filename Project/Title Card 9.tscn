text = "House #4:
As you enter the next house, youâ€™re struck by a disorientingly strong smell. 
Nothing quite like this has gone 12 rounds with your nostrils before, 
as it weakens your vision and shakes your core. The smell is deep and robust; 
more repugnant than raw sewage and more affecting than freshly baked cookies. 
Before your eyes started to water, you put your sleeve to your face to try and
block off some of the pain, continuing on into the home. 
As you pass the foyer and enter the main room, you identify the source of the smell.
