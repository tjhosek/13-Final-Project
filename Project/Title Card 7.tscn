text = "Amongst the piles of one man’s trash, there are notebooks piled up on a cardboard table. 
Some are leather bound, others are legal pads with a hand drawn front cover. 
As you pick one of them up, the amount of writing fit onto each page immediately strikes 
you. Words are written in the smallest possible font, with sentences running up and down 
and across the pages - with sections overlapping in different colored inks. 
While the majority of it is entirely illegible, and barely comprehensible when it isn’t, 
the random word or phrase will jump out to you. 
These are the portions that you were able to make out:
Treasure
Crash
Vitality
It will happen
Who now
When 
Alien
Blinding
