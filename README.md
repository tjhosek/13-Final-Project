# 13-Final-Project

This is the result of our game jam project. We split up into different sections, Trevor managed character behaviors and the item system, Luka managed the environment, Luke managed the story and Marcellus managed assets.
Several things went wrong. Several mechanics had to be scrapped last minute, many features are poorly implemented or not implemented at all, and there is effectively no game. The elements are there, they just arent arranged in any meaningful fashion.
The current "game" is a small platform where you can pick up and drop items by dragging them near your character or clicking on them on the ground. You move with wasd and interact with left mouse. Putting the computer parts onto the item reciever locks them in there.
